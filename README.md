Future Developments
-------------------

If/when further development happens these are some things we've considered.

* Getting better physics properties, especially with regards to the heads behaviour.
* The controls need to be more intuitive
* Allow not only surface hugging but also walking on the face of features - switching the mode between surface hugging and feature face walking.
* Aiming for slime should have clear indicator of where player is aiming.
* More slimey and sophisticated slime
* Multiplayer
* Eating of slime to improve sliming budget
* Eating of flies to add XP except from hitting flies and opponents
* Tons of upgrades:
  * Parachute slime
  * Spider man/grappling hook slime
  * Bouncing slime
  * Sneakers on feet (muffle walking sound, not scare enemies)
  * Feeding frenzy, faster eating of slime and prey
  * Dual slime cannons
  * Laser aim
  * Increased slime cannon force
  * Running shoes (walk faster)
  * Larger belly (more slime resources)
  * Mind control (opponent)
